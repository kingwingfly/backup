You may find that this mod is not included into crate hierarchy.

# Why?
This is used for doc tests.

Some traits in this crate need `protobuf::MessageFull`, such as `ProtoLocal: PathInfo + MessageFull`, which is auto implemented for all `T: PathInfo + MessageFull`.

To write `ProtoLocal` doc test, we have to got a struct (let's name it `Msg`) that satisfies `MessageFull` and `PathInfo` traits.

However, it is too hard to mamually implemente `MessageFull`. (`MessageFull` is generated by the famous [`protobuf`](https://protobuf.dev), the basis of kinds of `RPC`s). If we generate and `pub use` it in `my_crate`, we cannot `impl PathInfo for Msg` due to rust's orphan rule (We all know that document test is a kind of integration test).

```rust
// doc test
use my_crate::test_utils::Msg;
// `Msg` is in `my_crate`'s test_utils, which implemented `MessageFull`
use my_crate::{PathInfo, ProtoLocal};

impl PathInfo for Mag { ... } <- this violate rust's orphan rule
```

Instead we can:
```rust
// doc test
mod test_utils;
// Which is not included into crate hierarchy,
// and can only be included through `mod` language item.
use test_utils::msg::Msg;
use my_crate::{PathInfo, ProtoLocal};

impl PathInfo for Mag { ... }
// Here `Msg` is part of the doc test, just like `common` introduced in offical book about integration tests,
// and won't violate rust's orphan rule
```
