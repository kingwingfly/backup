# Why?
This is used for doc tests.

Some traits in this crate need `protobuf::MessageFull`, such as `ProtoLocal: PathInfo + MessageFull`, which is auto implemented for all `T: PathInfo + MessageFull`.

To write `ProtoLocal` doc test, we have to got a struct (let's name it `Msg`) that satisfy `MessageFull` and `PathInfo` traits.

However, it is too hard to mamually implemente `MessageFull`. (`MessageFull` is generated by the famous `protobuf`, basis of `gRPC`). If we generate and `pub use` it in `my_crate`, we cannot `impl PathInfo for Msg` due to rust's orphan rule (We all know that document test is a kind of integration test).

```rust
// doc test
use my_crate::{Msg, PathInfo, ProtoLocal};
use protobuf::MessageFull;

impl PathInfo for Mag { ... } <- this violate rust's orphan rule
```

Instead we can:
```rust
// doc test
mod test_utils;
use my_crate::{PathInfo, ProtoLocal};
use test_utils::msg::Msg;

impl PathInfo for Mag { ... } // Here `Msg` is part of the doc test, just like `common` introduced in offical book about integration tests
```
